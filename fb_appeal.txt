I added a privacy policy. The policy is available to authenticated users and the public. The app was unavailable the last time you checked it as I had not updated some of the dependencies on the hosting platform. I have now updated those dependancies and the app is working again. You can access it by logging in via Facebook or Google authentication from the main page: https://whatwherewhen.lakesoffire.org/
