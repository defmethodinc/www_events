== Potential Improvements

* Store all event start times in an associated 'event_times' table. Sorting by start time is easier in this format, parsing the input and storing it should be the same amount of work

* Store event start and end times instead of start and duration. We can render the times as start and duration, but storing two timestamps will make manipulation easier
